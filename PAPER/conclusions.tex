\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Cant colnclude that PINNS works best for SWE. changing layer and node configuration hardly makes a difference in training the networks. In the case of smooth solutions of wave models, PINNs predicts velocity(density) and/or height rather accurately. However for more complex/coupled systems, data-driven networks seem to work better. However data-fed networks need exhaustive datasets (solutions of model equations). In the absence of exhaustive data for learning of complex solutions, a hybrid training is recommended.

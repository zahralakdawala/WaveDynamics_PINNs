\abstract[Summary]{A vanilla feed forward neural network consists of neurons and layers and the mapping between input and output is approximated using a non linear function. The network is conventionally trained using data. In this work, we set up a neural network such that the spatio-temporal solution of time-dependent wave propogation models is learnt. This is done by providing the physical model, such as the 1D wave and shallow water wave equations and its associated boundary and initial conditions, as rules for learning the network. We invesitage the feasibility of data-driven and model-driven network predictions against numerical solutions. We  further investigate the accuracy of the trained network through different parameter configurations and look closely into the multi-objective loss function that is constructed by including the residual error of the physical equations and the associated initial and boundary conditions. We present the results of numerical solutions against solutions obtained from data and model-driven neural network using data and physics informed rules for learning. Lastly, we construct a hybrid data and physics driven network and show that this significantly improves the accuracy of the physics-driven network.}
